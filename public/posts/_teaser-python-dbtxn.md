The [python-dbtxn](https://github.com/echaozh/python-dbtxn) is a library I wrote to ease db accessing from Python programs. Directly calling Python DBI leaves a lot of boilerplate code all over the place, and boilerplate code is bad. I googled, and there are no dbtxn like libraries, so I wrote my own.
