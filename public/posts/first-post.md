This is my very first blog post on this [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered
static blog site.

Posts are generated from Markdown drafts. Layouts and other HTML files are
generated using [Blaze HTML](http://jaspervdj.be/blaze/). Raw HTML feels ugly,
especially with unbreakable long strings as attribute values. Generating HTMLs
with DSLs solves this problem effectively. I am considering switching to
some Ruby DSL later.
