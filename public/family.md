I have a lovely wife and a lovely daughter. My daughter is 20 months old now,
and talks a lot to herself and to us. She loves to help clean the home and in
other ways (though not very helpful).

I will write more about my family and post more photos.

My little girl can speak a lot now. And she can sing! She can sing the first
stanza of the song "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"! Considering she understands no
English, it is quite a feat. I am very proud of her, though her mother thinks
she speaks too much when trying very hard to declare whatever the mother does in
front of the child. If only she speaks as much when she grows up, then she can
be as successful as she wants. In the modern world, talking earns people fame
and wealth. Keep up the spirit, child!
